Material
========

Material is an ORM written in PHP, for PHP applications. It has been designed to work perfectly as a stand-alone component, so that you can use it in any environment, with any framework. Material provides:

- Support of all native database drivers (via PDO)
- Simultaneous connections to databases
- A query builder
- A schema builder
- A model class to play with PHP objects
- Support of custom object lifecycles
- Localized properties
- A migration and seeding mechanism
